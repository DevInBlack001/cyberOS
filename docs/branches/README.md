# CyberOS branches

Every branch in this repository has a charter file here. If you are about to create a
branch, add its charter in the same commit as the first piece of work.

## Rules

1. `main` is protected. It is always releasable and only receives merges via pull request.
2. Branch names are `<area>/<topic>`. The area matches a `CODEOWNERS` section so the right
   reviewer is requested automatically.
3. A branch owns **one** area of `profile/`. If your change spans two areas, that is two
   branches and two pull requests.
4. Branches are short-lived. Merge or close within a term; a branch older than that is
   rebased or abandoned, not left to rot.
5. Rebase onto `main` before opening the PR. Do not merge `main` into your branch.
